# IntelliSense for VBA Fucntions

When you enter a formula on a worksheet, Excel has two mechanisms to assist you in entering the right function call information.

### The 'Insert Function' dialog

This helps you to to select a function and enter or select the right arguments for the function.


### The in-sheet `Formula AutoComplete' features

While entering the formula in the cell, the function list and function details help is displayed as an IntelliSense-style popup.


### Descriptions and help information for user-defined functions (UDFs)

UDFs that are declared in .xll add-ins (like those made in .NET with Excle-DNA) can be registered with function and argument descriptions, and these will display in the 'Insert Function' dialog.
